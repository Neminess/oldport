     <p>My name is Noora Hiltunen and I am a student at <a href="https://www.taitotalo.fi" target="_blank">Taitotalo.</a></p>
     <h1>How I ended up here</h1>
          <p>Like most people, I also had big, unrealistic dreams and expectations about my adult life. I always imagined myself travelling the world and being a famous horseback-rider, a vet adn a singer.</p>
          <p>Obviously those were teenage-dreams and none of those happened. Over the years I have worked multiple jobs, learning about different career-options along the way.</p>
          <p>My previous jobs and schools include pastry-school, warehouse-worker (with a half-degree in that area), a kitchen worker, an office-asisstant/cleaner and working as a clerk at a gamestore.</p>
          <p>All of those taught me different things about myself and the working environments. When I ended up jobless and didn't get into any school I applied to, the social workers of Työkkäri introduced me to a place called Kuntoutussäätiö.</p>
     <h1>At Kuntoutussäätiö</h1>
          <p>During my time at Kuntoutussäätiö(which can be best described as a "rehabilitation center", I got introduced to HTML/CSS, video-editing and photography.</p>
          <p>I learned how a basic HTML-page works and what CSS does. The staff there was extremely encouraging, friendly and all-around great people.</p>
          <p>That is where the spark for coding was planted. Eventually my time at Kuntoutussäätiö came to an end and I applied to Tietix.</p>
     <h1>Tietix</h1>
          <p>Tietix is a workshop focused on computers, although they do have a packing-faction as well where they package incoming merch that is then sent to Kierrätyskeskus etc places for sale.</p>
          <p>I went to the coding-side/computer-side of Tietix. There, I was taught the basics of Python, got a small list of resources to use for studying and practice-projects.</p>
          <p>Tietix is the main reason for my current situation. I never thought I could be a coder, but the encouragement given there, and at Kuntoutussäätiö, gave me the kick to start studying more.</p>
          <p>When I had to leave Tietix, I applied to two different schools: Omnia and Taitotalo. I wasn't accepted to Omnia, but got a place at Taitotalo (which, funny enough, is an organisation that came to be from the unification of AmiEdu and AEL. Both are my former schools).</p>
          <p>All in all, it's been a long road to get here and I can wholeheartedly say, that without those two places that helped me find my own way, I wouldn't be where I am now.</p>
